 // RNG

 // Made a random name generator that shows a random name and displays previous names generated.

// Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment: The previous names section is suppose to retain all info about the last 5 generated students, not just the names. The website also lacks any responsiveness and the background breaks at different screen sizes (looping at larger screens and cutting off awkwardly at smaller ones).
